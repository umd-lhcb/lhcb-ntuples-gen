# lhcb-ntuples-gen [![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/lhcb-ntuples-gen.svg?build)](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/lhcb-ntuples-gen)
This is a special branch for comparing DaVinci scripts made by Phoebe and
Yipeng. We use DaVinci/v36r1p2 on the lxplus7 to do the comparison.

- The Phoebe's script is taken from [Phoebe's analysis preservation](https://github.com/umd-lhcb/RDRDstRun1AnalysisPreservation/blob/master/DaVinciReco/YCandReco3.py),
  with data conditions removed and automatic formatting by `black`.

- The Yipeng's script is taken from [version `0.7`](https://github.com/umd-lhcb/lhcb-ntuples-gen/tree/0.7)
  of this project, with tweaks for DaVinci-backward-compatibility.
