## Trigger Configuration Key (TCK)

- [This TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/TCK#TCKsh) explains
  briefly how to use `TCKsh` to study TCKs.
- [This page](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/) some TCK info for LHCb.

  !!! note
      This link have `.pdf` files that list all TCKs for a given period of
      time. For example, the [2012 year-end report](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/2012/last_report_2012_4000_summary.pdf)
      listed all TCKs (such as `0x8C0040`) in year 2012, but it _does not_ list
      TCK vs. time.
