## Trigger Configuration Key (TCK)

- This [TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/TCK#TCKsh) explains
  briefly how to use `TCKsh` to study TCKs.
- This [starter kit page](https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit-lessons/second-analysis-steps/hlt-intro.html#exploring-a-tck-list-of-trigger-lines)
  provides some sample usage for `TCKsh`
- This [page](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/) has all TCK info for
  LHCb.

    !!! note
        This link have `.pdf` files that list all TCKs for a given period of
        time.

        For example, in the [2016 year-end report](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/2016/last_report_2016_6500_summary.pdf):

        - All TCKs in this period, such as `0x1138160E`, are listed in **page 6**.
        - TCK vs. fill number are listed in **page 18**. The fill number is related
          to time, but the relationship is unknown to us[^1].
