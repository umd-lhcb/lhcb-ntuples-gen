## Trigger Configuration Key (TCK)

- [This TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/TCK#TCKsh) explains
  briefly how to use `TCKsh` to study TCKs.
- [This page](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/) some TCK info for LHCb.

    !!! note
        This link have `.pdf` files that list all TCKs for a given period of
        time.

        For example, in the [2016 year-end report](https://lbtriggerreport.cern.ch/reports/2016/last_report_2016_6500_summary.pdf):

        - All TCKs in this period, such as `0x1138160E`, are listed in page 6.
        - TCK vs. time are listed in page 18. Don't know how to translate the
          time stamps yet.
